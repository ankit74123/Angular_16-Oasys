  What is Angular ?
  =================
  Angular is a development platform for building a single-page application for mobile and desktop .  
  It is used for building client-side applications using HTML , CSS and a programming language like JavaScript or TypeScript.
  Angular is not a programming language in itself like JavaScript . It is a framework of JavaScript.

  Angular is a JavaScript Framework which allows us to create Single Page Applications(SPA).

  Framework
  =========
  A framework is like a platform for developing software applications.
  A framework can have pre-defined classes and functions that can be re-used to add several functionalities , which otherwise we would have to write from scratch by our own. 

  A framework is a collection of pre-defined classes and methods which provides APIs for performing different operations when used in an application.

  Single Page Application
  =======================
  A single page application is a web application , which has only one HTML page .
  When we navigate around , only the content of that HTML page changes . The page itself never changes.

  Advantage of SPA 
  ================
  Since we are using JavaScript to change the content of the page , it is much faster . Here we are not reaching out to the server to request a new piece of HTML data , every time 
  we navigate to a different URL.

  This allows us to create an application which is fast and reactive.

  Limitations of JavaScript/jQuery
  ================================
  Vanilla JavaScript or jQuery code becomes hard to maintain and we will need a way to properly structure our application.
  A lot of applications built using vanilla JavaScript / jQuery is hard to test.
  There are some functionalities which we will have to write from scratch when using JavaScript / jQuery.

  Advantage of using Angular
  ==========================
  Angular gives our application a clean and loosely coupled structure that is easy to understand and maintain.
  It brings a lot of utility code which can be re-used in lot of applications . Especially , when dealing with user navigation & browser history.
  Application built with Angular are more testable.

  Versions of Angular
  ===================

  Angular JS was not designed with the need of todays applications.
